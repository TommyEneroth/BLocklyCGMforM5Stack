# BLocklyCGMforM5Stack

So thanks to the help from my friends in a bunch of different tech companies, VMWare, Google, Microsoft, Oracle to name a few…

I created the M5 Scout. Here are my design goals:

 1) Reuse as much of someone else's good tech so that I don’t have to rebuild it: Nightscout! https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor
 2) Leverage the most basic programming so I don’t have to learn to code: Blockly https://flow.m5stack.com/
 3) Have the ability to user a cheap product that can display Blood Glucose data all the time: M5Stack

PS. Also I might build a version 2.0 with blinking Lights, alarms, different Wifis,  electric shocks for when his numbers are out of whack…

For now, the buttons beep and you can make the screen brighter or dimmer (for nighttime use) 
On screen you can continuously see:
BG level (Green when in range red when out of range)
Difference with the last BG level
Time since last update was received (for example if the Dexcom CGM is far from Phone)
The Trend Arrow
Screen brightness (but we could remove that…)

All you need is an M5 Stack device

Let me know what you think and what should be part of Version 2.0
